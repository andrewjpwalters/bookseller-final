## Usage

This is an application built with Ruby on Rails and React with photo storage support from Active Storage and Amazon S3. It functions as a marketplace where users are able to list and sell books. Users are able to create a profile and then log in to submit sales posts with tags and with an accompanying image that will be stored on S3. Users can edit and delete their own posts. Users are then able to make offers on other users' sales posts, initiating a coversation in which the users will be able to send messages back and forth. Authorizaion ensures that users are not able to affect other users' content.
